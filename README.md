### Let's get started and clone down the necessary projects you'll need to get up and running!

### Client Side React Project Setup
1. First create a directory named `Bangazon` that you can download the two required repos into.
2. Inside the root level of the `Bangazon` folder add a folder named `Client`, then download the project repo into `Client` with `clone git@github.com:nss-cohort-40/bangazon-ecommerce-client-silly-walkers-ecommerce-client.git` and `cd` into it after it has downloaded.
3. Once fully installed run `npm install` in your terminal to install all project requirements.
4. Once the download is completed you can use `npm start` to start the application.

### API Side Database Project Setup
1. Inside the root level of the `Bangazon` folder add another folder named `API`. cd into `API`. 
2. Download the project repo into `API` with `clone git@github.com:nss-cohort-40/bangazon-ecommerce-api-silly-walkers-ecommerce-api.git` and `cd` into it after it has downloaded.
3. If you do not have an environment already created we'll need to make one with `python -m venv bangazonEnv`
4. Once the environment is created, you'll need to activate it before any installations. Use `source ./bangazonEnv/bin/activate`
5. use `pip install django autopep8 pylint djangorestframework django-cors-headers pylint-django` to install the requirements for this project.
6. To create the database in the project you'll run `python manage.py makemigrations`.
7. As long as there are no errors you will now run `python manage.py migrate`
8. You should now be able to create a connection to this database using the `sqlite3` installation and connection setup. We suggest following the instruction on this website: `https://github.com/nashville-software-school/bangazon-llc/blob/master/book-2-sql/chapters/SQL_INTRO.md`
9. We have built fixtures with dummy data to get you up and running. To add these to the database, in your terminal and while running your environment and server, use `python managa.py loaddata users` Run this same code for each fixture but changing users out for `cusomters`, `order_procuts`, `payment_types`, `product_types`, `products`, and `orders`.

Letâ€™s be sure we have everything connected and loaded. 
1. In your browser you will see your data available by visiting `http://localhost:8000/`
2. To view the client-side application you will visit `http://localhost:3000/`
3. While on the client side website create a user account using the Register link in the menu bar. 
4. Once logged in you will be able to navigate the site and create a product to sell.
